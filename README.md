Rename the x and y variables h and s (for "hue" and "saturation"). In your README.me file, answer: what changes in the animation? What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?

There is no change in the animation if just change names of variables, because computer would't understand these letter. To make computer execute a command, we need to give a meaning to these variable, such as "= numbers".
